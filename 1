feat(keymap): add mo1_with_shift macro for dual-shift layer activation

Add `mo1_with_shift` macro that temporarily activates `layer_1` while
holding both `LSHFT` keys, with `LSHFT` modifier also held during the
activation. This allows shifted key outputs (e.g. `5` → `%`) when
navigating `layer_1` via the dual-shift combo.
